Relational Features

Right now, we only support tree structures.  What about a general graph?  We don't want it to be completely transparent, because then the client can't really see what's going on.

The relational model has keys and stuff.  Maybe that stuff can be adopted?  Essentially, fuse the relational model with algebraic types.
