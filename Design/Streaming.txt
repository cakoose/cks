Stronger Typing

The current API is:

   parse(InputStream) -> MassiveDataStructure

Need a way to avoid loading the entire thing into memory.

Simple solution is to have a weakly-typed SAX-like API.  But can we make it strongly typed (where each event is a marshalled object instead of the generic Value types)?

Maybe combine with query language.  Converting stuff to lists covers the common case.  Lets say you have query string that transforms 'MassiveDataStructure' into 'List(OtherStructure)'

   parseAndTransform(InputStream, queryString) -> Iterator<OtherStructure>
