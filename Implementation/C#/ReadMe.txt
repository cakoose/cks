====================================
CKS C# Runtime Library

Requirements:
- A Microsoft .Net 2.0 implementation (Mono 2.4 works).
- The Mono.Security.dll (for Mono.Math.BigInteger)

To build:
- On Unix, with Mono: ./build
- On Windows, with Microsoft .Net: build

This will produce "Output/Cks.Runtime.dll".  The code generated by
the CKS Bindings Generator depends on this library.
