# C# Example

First, generate C# code that can read and write the data types defined in "students.tcks":

    > cks gen-c# students.tcks Example.Students gen/Students.hs

The "Example.Students" is the C# namespace that the generated classes will be assigned.  The "gen/" is the directory that the generated files will be written to.

Example use of generated bindings:

{pygmentsfile: {lang: "csharp", filename: "examples/C#/AddShaggy.cs"}}
