# Java Example

First, generate Java code that can read and write the data types defined in "students.tcks":

    > cks gen-java students.tcks org.example.students gen/

The "org.example.students" is the Java package that the generated classes will be assigned.  The "gen/" is the directory that the generated files will be written to.

Example use of generated bindings:

{pygmentsfile: {lang: "java", filename: "examples/Java/AddShaggy.java"}}
