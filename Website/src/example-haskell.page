# Haskell Example

First, generate Haskell code that can read and write the data types defined in "students.tcks":

    > cks gen-haskell students.tcks Students gen/Students.hs

The "Students" is the Haskell module that the generated classes will be assigned.  The "gen/Students.hs" is the file that the generated Haskell code will be written to.

Example use of generated bindings:

{pygmentsfile: {lang: "haskell", filename: "examples/Haskell/Main.hs"}}
